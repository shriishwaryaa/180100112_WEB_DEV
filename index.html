            Hey! Welcome to my webpage. Do give it a read and let me know what you think through the feedback section below.<br><br>
            I am a UG third year student at the Indian Institue of Technology, Mumbai. I am pursuing a Mechanical Engineering major. And also, a minor in Computer Science yay!<br><br>
            My interests lie in the intersection of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. I've always been fascinated by robots. My interest in computer science developed
            while doing a project for the 12th standard board examination. My teammates and I worked on building a timetable generator based on number of subjects,
            number of hours available, and priorities etc. It was fun and sparked my interests. <br><br>
            I like to do a lot things - draw, paint, watch series and movies, and work on small DIY projects.
          </p>

            I work under Prof. Vivek Sangwan in the Intelligent Dynamical Ubiquitous Systems Lab
            which is part of the Mechanical Engineering department in IITB.
            I joined the lab after the lockdown was imposed and I have learnt a lot in such a short period of time! <br><br>
            I started out with manipulator dynamics and the Euler-Lagrange theorem.
            Then I simulated motions of links of a manipulator when given the torques exerted on them.
            Now, I have completed studying about manipulator kinematics, both forward and inverse, dynamics and PD control.<br><br>
            I also learnt about quadcopters through the Aerial Robotics Course by University of Pennsylvania on Coursera.
            It covered basics about rotation matrices, dynamics, trajectory generation and controls. The course had very interesting videos
            on swarms.

            This is an Android app development project that I did as an internship during April and May.
            It is an app to track and monitor pest traps on farms. Can't disclose anything else as of now.<br><br>
            The app uses Firebase Authentication, Realtime-database and RoomDatabase! I built the app using Android Studio.
            I completed an Android course through the Edufect platform in Summer 2019.<br><br>
            If you wanna get started Android App Development, I would suggest that you should start by reading the book Head First Android Development.
            It is great for beginners as it explains everything through ample amount of pictures.

            This is the well-known online HarvardX course "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python".
            The course was very good and anyone with basic python knowledge is ready to take it.<br><br>
            This course had 9 quizzes with 4 questions each and 12 projects. You need to get a score of 70% or above to pass.
            It covered topics such as propositional search, knowledge representation, bayesian networks, constraint satisfaction problems,
            backtracking search, convolutional and recurrent neural networks, naive bayes classification, bag of words model etc.<br><br>
            It also taught me various algorithms such as breadth-first search, depth-first search, A* search, minimax, tf-idf, Q-learning, and KNN classifier etc.
            As part of the course, I learnt to develop games such as tic tac toe, minesweeper, nim etc.

            Conversational chatbot was a project under the Summer of Code conducted by the Web and Coding Club, IITB. I mentored 8 students as part of this project.
            All my mentees were taught the basics of machine learning, neural netowrks, Firebase, TensorFlow and Android app development.<br><br>
            We built a chatbot that trained on the Cornell movie dialog corpus. The bot was based on a Seq2Seq model. Some of my mentees added an attention mechanism to
            improve the accuracy / performance of the chatbot. We used tfLite to add our chatbot to the app.<br><br>

            I started learning web development with the help of the Learner's space initiative. This is the 4th week of the course.
            Building a personal landing page is the assignment for this week. We have been taught HTML, CSS, JavaScript and BootStrap so far. <br><br>
            In the upcoming weeks we will be taught Django and database management. The grading for the course is as follows :
